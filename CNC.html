What is a CNC Machine?
A CNC machine is a computer-controlled manufacturing tool used to perform a variety of tasks with high precision and accuracy. It operates based on a set of programmed instructions and can automate processes that would otherwise be done manually.

How CNC Machines Work:

Design and Programming: The process begins with creating a design using computer-aided design (CAD) software. The design is then translated into machine-readable instructions using computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software. These instructions determine the toolpaths and operations that the CNC machine will execute.

Input of Instructions: The programmed instructions are loaded into the CNC machine's computer, often referred to as the "controller." The controller interprets the instructions and controls the movement of the machine's components.

Movement and Operation: CNC machines have various axes (typically X, Y, and Z) that control the movement of the tool or the workpiece. The controller precisely moves the tool along these axes to perform cutting, shaping, drilling, or other operations on the workpiece.

Feedback and Correction: Many CNC machines have sensors and feedback systems that continuously monitor the position and performance of the machine. If any deviations from the programmed path or unexpected issues occur, the machine can make real-time corrections to ensure accuracy.

Types of CNC Machines:
There are numerous types of CNC machines, each specialized for specific tasks. Some common types include:

CNC Mills: Used for cutting and drilling. They operate vertically or horizontally.
CNC Lathes: Used for turning and creating cylindrical shapes.
CNC Routers: Primarily used for cutting and shaping wood, plastic, and metal.
CNC Plasma Cutters: Used for cutting metal using a plasma torch.
